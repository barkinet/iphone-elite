**About us**: We don't like secrecy, we don't take ourselves too seriously, and we're not out to make money. If you want to help, you can keep us company on IRC (we stay up very late) or send us iPhones (working or not) for testing. Monetary contributions are not accepted. If you have money you want to donate, please donate it to a good charity.

The name "iPhone Elite" started out as a joke when the iPhone Dev Team forked due to some personality issues. Fortunately, these issues have long been resolved and the Dev Team and the Elite Team are basically reunited and are working together cooperatively.

ACUJO is NOT and he has NEVER BEEN a member of this team
He only offered the former irc server and then abused it.
