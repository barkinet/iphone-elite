# Album3.plist #

On my 3 iphones i found this file:

/System/Library/Frameworks/PhotoLibrary.framework/Album3.plist

Inside it there was a dotmac account and password:

UserName: grape01

Password: 123456

Well..
That happened to be a real account.
There also were a few emails on that account from an apple software engineer.

I changed the password.
And I replied to the test email...

But now i wonder:
  1. what was that for ?
  1. why it was there ?
  1. what will happen now ? :)

**UPDATE**

Maybe nobody read this Wiki...
Or maybe nobody thought about it...
But I found out that there were also: grape02 and grape03 accounts :)
With the same password obviously.

Now i changed all 3 accounts password.
And I still wonder...
