# How to Unlock a 1.1.1 Phone #

Thanks to functionality already built into the iPhone, an unlock is possible from any software or firmware version.  With your iPhone turned on, but sleeping, hit the home button once.  You will be prompted to "slide to unlock".  Touch your finger to the slider button and drag it all the way to the right, then release.  Voila!  Your iPhone is now unlocked.  Enjoy!

**Important note:** To prevent your phone from becoming locked again, touch your screen and move your finger around.
