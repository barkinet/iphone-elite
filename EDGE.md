# Introduction #

Since TIM (Italy) supports EDGE, today i did a full test.


# Details #

Considering the limitations of the standard, I think EDGE experience was GREAT.

Youtube videos are compressed to a higher ratio if you connect using EDGE.
They are blocky, indeed, but still you can watch them.

And now a field test of speeds achieved:

Upload (from phone to network. sftp get from another host):

100% 3089KB     10KB/s 00:04:41

Download (from network to phone. sftp put from another host):

100% 3089KB     22KB/s 00:02:16

As you can see, **downstream** is about 176 Kilobit/sec but there was SSH and a VPN.. so I think the actual speed could be something like 200-256 kilobit.

Upstream is a half.. so it could be 128kilobit. (80 kilobit thru SsH and VPN).
