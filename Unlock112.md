The 1.1.2 baseband (on a 3.9 bootloader) can be unlocked with anySIM 1.2.1u. Essentially, anySIM 1.2.1u is the same thing as anySIM 1.1 - it has just been modified to unlock the 1.1.2 baseband firmware.

**This will not unlock phones that came with 1.1.2 out of the box, because the newer phones have a new bootloader that does not allow for unlocking at the moment.**
