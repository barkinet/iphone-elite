| **I have just recently purchased an iPhone from an Apple or AT&T store. Can I unlock this phone?** |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

It depends on how recently you purchased it. The newer iPhones that are currently available in stores have a new baseband bootloader that is currently not possible to unlock. The easiest way to check your phone is to look at the activation screen. Do you see a screen that says "activate iPhone, connect to iTunes"? If so, your phone can more than likely be unlocked. However, if you see a screen with a picture of a cable and the iTunes icon, your phone cannot be unlocked at this time.

If you've just purchased an iPhone then it is almost guaranteed to have this new bootloader. Back in December of 2007 (and earlier) it was possible to find older iPhones; this task is impossible now.

You need to [revirginize your phone](http://dev).

| **Is it possible to completely remove any sign that anySIM 1.0.x, iUnlock, Unlock.app, HaRRo's GUI unlock, or George Hotz's hardware unlock ever touched my phone?** |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Yes. [Revirginize your phone](http://dev).

| **Can I downgrade the 4.01.13 (1.1.1) baseband to the 03.14.08 (1.0.2) baseband, but keep the 1.1.1 OS firmware so I can use my unlocked iPhone in 1.1.1?** |
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

This is possible, but it is not recommended. [Revirginize your phone](http://dev).

| **I used George Hotz's spoofed IPSF server with success. What should I do?** |

In that case, you don't need to do anything. Your seczone's lock tables are correct and you can upgrade to 1.1.1, unless you used IPSF without saving your seczone beforehand. In that case, please refer to TEASecZone for a discussion of the IPSF unlock.
