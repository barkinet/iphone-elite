# Introduction #

I think I could post just a line about this, but i feel verbose:

run minicom on /dev/tty.debug !

That's the baseband and you DON'T NEED to kill commcenter :)

# Details #

Possible applications are:

1) manipulating the baseband in parallel with the system.

2) enabling trace and debug to see what the iphone does.

3) redirect /dev/tty.debug on a bluetooth connection (any phone does that).

4) use your own fantasy :)

P.S.
Why do I seem to be tho only one curious about anything in the system ?
That could really be found by anyone!!
