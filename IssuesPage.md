# Introduction #

This is to explain to people that aren't necessarily familiar with this type of a system what the 'Issues' tab is for and not for.

# Details #

The 'Issues' tab is submit bugs, feature requests, and/or other defects in the iPhone Elite software.  It is not a place to discuss general iPhone issues or issues with other tools (except as used with iPhone Elite software).

Some examples of things that would be appropriate:

```
The virginizer tool failed for (...) reason

anySIM 1.1p did (...) instead of what I expected

I had a problem with (...) version of the virginizer script
```

Things that do not belong:

```
I had (...) problem up/downgrading from (1.0.2/1.1.1)

How do I use (iUnlock/anySIM/...)?

After upgrading to 1.1.1 my phone (bricked/lost wifi/...) -- unless you ran the virginizer and suspect it's related
```

I have to include a special note here regarding people not reading and following directions.  We sat down and took the time to write them, so we expect you to read and follow them.  If you don't, and you brick your phone, I don't have a lot of sympathy for you.

The virginizer can be a dangerous tool if you're not careful with it.  If you power off in the middle of it running and you get unlucky, you may end up wiping out your seczone completely.  That means your phone **really is a brick** until we get around to releasing a tool to rebuild the seczone.

Please don't be upset at us though, we didn't cause the damage that needed repair in the first place, we just found a way to fix it.  If you do as instructed, and create backups **AND COPY THEM OFF OF YOUR PHONE**, you should be fine no matter what.

If you don't understand any part of this process, you probably should find someone to help or explain it to you and have the willpower to wait to run the tool until you at least have a basic understanding of how it works.

The scripts were created to help keep the process simple for people, but there is no substitute for knowledge and experience.
