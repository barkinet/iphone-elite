# Introduction #

Freeloader is an attempt at writing a reusable and extensible loader framework for the baseband.  Think of it as an interactive low level debugger for inside the baseband.

# Details #

It's in the early stages of development.  Since we have no docs for the PMB8876, everything has to be done through RCE and trial and error.  That said, everyone is welcome to contribute and share.
