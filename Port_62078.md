# Port 62078 (TCP) #

This port is used internally while syncing.
Strangely the LISTEN is done on **.62078 instead of: 127.0.0.1.62078**

So, i prepared iTunes for a full SYNC iPhone >> PC.

Then fired up tcpdump -i lo0 -w DUMP

# Details #

Analyzing the dump with EtherReal notes a few interesting things..

I leave to you to experiment and reverse engineer.
